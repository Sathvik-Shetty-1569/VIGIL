## What is VIGIL?

VIGIL is an **AI Productivity Agent** that silently observes your goals, breaks them into actionable tasks, and scores your progress with cold, calculated honesty — no motivational fluff, no push notifications, no empty hype.

You set the goals. You do the work. VIGIL watches.

At the end of the week, it delivers a **verdict**.

---

## Features

### 🎯 Goal Management
Set goals with deadlines. VIGIL keeps track — no reminders, no nagging.

### 🤖 AI Task Breakdown
Powered by **LLaMA 3.3 70B via Groq**, VIGIL auto-generates a smart, realistic task list for every goal you add.

### ✅ Daily Task Tracking
Check off tasks as you complete them. Watch your progress bar move. Feel the weight of the ones you haven't touched.

### 📊 Weekly Review
Every week, VIGIL reviews what you did — and what you didn't. It scores your week and delivers a **cold, honest verdict** using AI analysis.

### 🔐 Auth & Onboarding
